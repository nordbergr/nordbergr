## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Currently a software Engineer at Wayfair working on their Android app and graphql backend.

## Background
I started my software career at Wayfair in September of 2015.  I've worked on several teams at Wayfair spanning topics such as: test automation frameworks, dev ops, release engineering, web development and most recently Android development.

## Music
[see what I'm listening to or follow me on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/125367238?si=3_jRvff7QzuuZTxP6EkcPg)

Please suggest some new music for me!  I'm currently on a low-fi kick right now but I'll listen to almost anything!
