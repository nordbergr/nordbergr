## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Outside of my fulltime job at Wayfair to surface accurate and reliable package tracking Iâ€™m currently working on Rodi.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any open source projects!  I have experience with Android development, Web dev and even worked on some chatbots for Wayfair.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: bobn93@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I taught high school marching band for 8 years.

## Background
I started my software career at Wayfair back in September of 2015.  I've worked on several teams at Wayfair spanning topics such as: test automation frameworks, dev ops, release engineering, Android development, and most recently web development.

## Rodi
Rodi is a platform to bring together musicians, fans and venues.  Follow bands, get gigs, see who is playing at your favorite spot, find something new near by and more.  Expect to see things from us in the near future!

## Music
[see what I'm listening to or follow me on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/125367238?si=3_jRvff7QzuuZTxP6EkcPg)

Please suggest some new music for me!  I'm currently on a low-fi kick right now but I'll listen to almost anything!
