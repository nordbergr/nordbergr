## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Currently a software Engineer at Wayfair working on their Android app.  On the side I'm working on a project with my friends and we call that [Rodi](https://www.myrodi.com)

## Background
I started my software career at Wayfair back in September of 2015.  I've worked on several teams at Wayfair spanning topics such as: test automation frameworks, dev ops, release engineering, web development and most recently Android development.

## Rodi
Rodi is a platform to bring together musicians, fans and venues.  Follow bands, bands get gigs, fans see who is playing at your favorite spot, find something new near by and more.  We launched our app as invite only so far reach out to me if you'd like an invite! Download it here:

Please suggest some new music for me!  I'm currently on a low-fi kick right now but I'll listen to almost anything!
