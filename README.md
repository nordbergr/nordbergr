## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­  By day, a software engineer at Wayfair, by night, working on [Rodi](https://www.myrodi.com)
- ðŸ‘¯  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any open source projects!  I have experience with Android development, Web dev and even worked on some chatbots for Wayfair.
- ðŸ“«  How to reach me: bobn93@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„  Pronouns: He/Him

## Background
I started my software career at Wayfair back in September of 2015.  I've worked on several teams at Wayfair spanning topics such as: test automation frameworks, dev ops, release engineering, Android development, and most recently web development.

## Rodi
Rodi is a platform to bring together musicians, fans and venues.  Follow bands, bands get gigs, fans see who is playing at your favorite spot, find something new near by and more.  Expect to see our app hit the app store soon and reach out to me if you'd like an invite!

## Music
[see what I'm listening to or follow me on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/125367238?si=3_jRvff7QzuuZTxP6EkcPg)

Please suggest some new music for me!  I'm currently on a low-fi kick right now but I'll listen to almost anything!
